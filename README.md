# Blue V.2

Blue V.2 is a short and unbalanced RPG that you probably shouldn't play.

## Installation

### Option 1

This is the fastest and easiest option. Simply download the Blue_V.2.zip file and uncompress it, then start the .exe file in the folder created.

### Option 2

This option is more complicated, but doesn't include starting a .exe file.
You will have to have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 (3.8 or any 3.X should work)
- Pygame (pip install pygame)

1. Download the Blue_V.2_Source.zip file and uncompress it.
2. Start Game.py
